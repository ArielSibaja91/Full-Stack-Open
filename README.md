## Bloglist in Redux
The final project of part 7 of the basic course is a list of blogs to be developed with React Query or Redux, for consistency it was decided to use Redux. The goal was to unite the backend developed previously in part 4 with a complete frontend (styles, routing and state management).

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,express,mongo&theme=light)](https://skillicons.dev)
<br>
For the backend, NodeJS with Express was used to develop a RESTful API that communicates with MongoDB using the Mongoose ODM. Bycrypt is used for secure password hashing, authentication is token-based with the use of JWT.


### Frontend:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,redux,mui,vite&theme=light)](https://skillicons.dev)
<br>
For the frontend, Vite is used to create a React project and manage the development environment. Redux Toolkit is used for state management, axios for making HTTP requests to the backend. Material UI was used for styles and responsiveness.
